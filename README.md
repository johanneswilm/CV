CV
====

A simple system to render 5 different CVs each in English, German, Danish, Spanish and Norwegian for different purposes without having to retype everything.

This is just made to work for me personally.

LaTeX is used for rendering.


Installation
==
Enter the sources dir.
To install needed dependencies on Ubuntu, run ./install_ubuntu.sh .
To change the PDF files, adjust the contents of the *.tex files and run ./compile_all_cvs
